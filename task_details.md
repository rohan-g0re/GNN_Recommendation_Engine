Goal: Develop a backend recommendation engine capable of identifying optimal venues and 
compatible individuals. 
Note: Consider how data sources such as time spent viewing posts, filter interaction 
frequency, real-time location data, expressed interest in places and people, and/or connected 
social media accounts might contribute to the recommendation engine's effectiveness. 
Requirements: 
● Recommendation Engine: Choose your preferred methodology (machine learning 
models of your choice, or other approaches) to power the recommendation system. The 
engine should include: 
○ Spatial Analysis: Determine the best location for the user based on their 
preferences and constraints. 
○ Social Compatibility: Assess high compatibility scores for people to go with the 
user and incentives to attend.  
● Agents: Implement agents to generate automated reservations, bookings, or purchases 
once users have agreed to go to a place for a seamless user experience 
● The specific implementation and architecture are at your discretion, and you will be 
assessed on this.
